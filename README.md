# Product Recommendation System
## 1. Introduction
### Goal:
This project develops a product recommendation system for an ecommerce platform. The system uses several recommendation techniques including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approach, and a multi-modal deep learning model to provide highly personalized product suggestions to users based on purchase history, browsing behavior, product metadata, images, and graph relationships.
### Main Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on users with similar purchasing behavior.
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends products based on the attributes of the products the users interacted with.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more robust recommendations, includes fallback with most popular products.
- **Multi-Modal Deep Learning**: Integrates user–item interactions, product images, text descriptions, and product–graph relationships into a unified multi-modal deep learning architecture for highly accurate recommendations.
- **Web Interface**: A web application built with Sreamlit for easy interaction and visualization of recommendations.
